## README for Unique Starting City 

## Problem Statement 
This program determines the preferred starting city for a circular route based on the distances between cities and the available fuel at each city. The car can only complete the route if there is enough fuel to reach the next city.

## Prerequisites
 Install Python 3.12.7 on your machine.(https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.7/python-3.12.7-amd64.exe)

## How to Execute the Program in IDLE
Step 1. Open IDLE
	Launch IDLE.
Step 2. Open the Python File
	In IDLE, click on `File-> Open', and navigate to the directory where you saved the 'unique_starting_city.py' file. Select that file and click `Open`.
Step 3. How to Modify Input Values 
	The program allows user input to change the values of city_distances, fuel, and mpg in case we want to try different examples such as:
 	city_distances = [5, 25, 15, 10, 15]
 	fuel = [1, 2, 1, 0, 3]
 	mpg = 10
Step 5: Once after modifying the inputs, Click on the 'Run' option from the taskbar and then click 'Run Module'.
Step 6: Executes the program

## How to compile program on terminal
	Step 1: Launch terminal
	Step 2: Navigate to the "Problem_3" directory (Example: cd ../CPSC-535-Project-1/Problem_3)
	Step 3: Compile and run the code using the command: python3 unique_starting_city.py
	Step 4: 
		Once the program begins running, users can select the number of cities and allows input on city_distances, fuel, and mpg in case we want to try different examples such as:
		city_distances = [5, 25, 15, 10, 15]
		fuel = [1, 2, 1, 0, 3]
 		mpg = 10
